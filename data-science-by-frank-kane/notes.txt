conda path : /anaconda3/bin
jupyter notebook : cd '/Users/yogwalia/Desktop/Data Science/1. Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python - Frank Kane/MLCourse'

Section 1: Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------
1. Anaconda Distribution : Python/R IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Used for Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.
2. conda install pydotplus : Used to visualise decision trees.
3. conda install tensorflow : Used to create deep neural networks.
4. jupyter notebook : Used to open ipynb (Interactive Python NoteBook) files on web browser within a folder.
5. pandas [Panel Data] : Python Library used to handle tabular data (Load, Clean, Manipulate) creating 'dataframes' and 'series'.
6. numpy [Numerical Python] : Python library used to create N-Dimensional arrays.
7. sklearn or scikit_learn : Python Machine Learning Library used to train the models or algorithms.

Tabular Data -> pandas (Load, Clean, Manipulate) -> Transform -> numpy array -> input -> sklearn or scikit_learn

Section 2: Statistics And Probability Refresher, Python Practice
-------------------------------------------------
1. Types Of Data : Numerical [Discrete or Continuous], Categorical and Ordinal
2. Mean, Median And Mode : Median is less susceptible [Harmfully Impacted] than Mean if an outlier is added.
3. Variance And Standard Deviation : Two fundamental quantities which measures the spread of the data distribution.
4. Variance [Population Or Sample] : Measures How 'Spread-Out' The Data Is. Average Of The Squared Difference From The Mean.
5. Standard Deviation : Square Root Of The Variance. It is used to examine how 'extreme' or 'far' the data point is from the mean.
6. Probability Density Function [Continuous Data] : Gives the Probability of a data point falling within some given range of a given value.
7. Probability Mass Function [Discrete Data] : Gives the Probability of a data point having non-range value.
